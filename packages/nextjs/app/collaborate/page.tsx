You'll give us the deployer address so our 500k and 5M clubs whitelist it and participate in the bonding curve auction. These are not paper hands. Only those who agree to a minimum 1-week hold will get the deployer address information. Even more, some of us will add to the Uniswap liquidity pool.

1. Staking vault: Stake and lock $PAWSY for various periods.
2. Reward token: Only mintable by the staking vault; tracks user ecosystem contributions.
3. Rewards market: Enables devs/DAO to create campaigns for token exchanges (e.g., reward tokens for NFTs).

• Top programmers that care about AI agents, MEV, the EVM or the SVM.

• A moderator for our soon-to-be-launched Discord server.

• People who understand how LLMs, datasets, embeddings, Eliza, Rig, etc., work to help us add more AI Agents into the Bark Ruffalo ecosystem.

• People with a good understanding of scaling and hardening AI agents against hacks, uptime loss, etc.

• Someone who can help us create a 3D model of Bark Ruffalo that we can use on Virtuals Protocol or TikTok to live stream.

• Designers, meme creators, artists.

• Anyone else who thinks they have something good to contribute to the ecosystem. We always prefer to work with people with something at stake; therefore, please consider first buying $PAWSY, then migrating, then staking. This also acts as a filter for us to understand that you're serious about participating. We're currently inundated with requests from marketers, fake influencers, etc., through Telegram and X.`,
